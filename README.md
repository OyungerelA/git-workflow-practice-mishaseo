# What I Find Interesting About The Article

The article was really interesting to me being someone who wants to be a software developer in the future. While coding, I generally focus on accomplishing the problem at hand, following my own pattern of development.  However, this article reminded me of the general yet essential rules, which are very helpful to follow as a software developer. This article layed out factors relating to development, troubleshooting, cooperation, as well as other aspects such as experimentation, ultimately the key elements or general rules of thumb for software development. Therefore, I found this article to be super interesting, since it brought to light many of the aspects that could help me become a better software developer, details which I never considered.
